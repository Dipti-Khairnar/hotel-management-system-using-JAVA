# hotel-management-system-using-JAVA
🏨 **Hotel Reservation System (Java)**  A Java-based application to search, book, and manage hotel rooms with categories like Standard, Deluxe, and Suite. Users can make or cancel reservations, view booking details, and simulate payments. Built using OOP principles with Database/File I/O for storing bookings and room availability.
## 🏨 Hotel Reservation System – Project Report

### 📌 Project Overview

The **Hotel Reservation System** is a Java-based application designed to manage hotel room bookings efficiently. The system allows users to search available rooms by category, make reservations, cancel bookings, simulate payments, and view booking details. It uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and Database or File I/O for storing room availability and reservation records.

### 🎯 Aim

To design and develop a hotel room booking system that automates reservation management, improves efficiency, and ensures accurate storage of booking data.

---

### 🥅 Objectives

* To create a system for searching rooms by category (Standard, Deluxe, Suite).
* To allow users to book and cancel reservations.
* To implement payment simulation functionality.
* To store booking and room availability data using Database or File I/O.
* To apply OOP concepts in system development.

---

### ⭐ Key Features

* Room categorization (Standard, Deluxe, Suite)
* Search available rooms
* Make and cancel reservations
* Payment simulation
* View booking details and reservation history
* Persistent data storage

---

### 🏗 System Design

The system follows OOP principles and consists of:

* **Room Class** – Stores room details and availability.
* **Customer Class** – Manages customer information.
* **Reservation Class** – Handles booking details.
* **Payment Class** – Simulates payment processing.
* **Main Class** – Controls application flow and user interaction.

Data is stored using file handling (File I/O) or a database (MySQL/SQLite) to maintain records permanently.
